#Node.js color generator
s
Create an application that will return a random color in the command line.

It should work like this:

When a user enters node index.js in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated.

It should look pretty close to this:

In addition to node index.js, it should also be able to accept the request for a:

hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
luminosity (e.g. light or dark)
...and then generate random colors that match those choices.

For example:

Stretch goals
If a user types "ask" instead of a color name, print questions to ask the user for the name of the color and the luminosity
If a user types a size in the format of WWxHH (eg. 31x9) before the color and luminosity, it will use this as the size of the box
